-Using diff command is really helpfull for finding mistakes in your code!!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-Sometimes, whithouth saving your histort, you can use minutes or hours to get back to the privious working version of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

-Its hard for program to choose when to commit your owrk.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-Because for programming sometimes we need to change multiple files to resolve one problem.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-git log shows histroy and git diff compares two files from history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-Because i got files saved i can get back to.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-I want to try sabing this file to git.

Thanks,
